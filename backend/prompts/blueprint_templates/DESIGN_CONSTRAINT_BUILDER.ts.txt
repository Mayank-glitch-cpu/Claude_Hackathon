## DESIGN_CONSTRAINT_BUILDER Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Constraints Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each constraint, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "constraint1", "constraint2", "rule_a")
- **text**: Extract exact constraint text from component_specifications (e.g., "Must fit in 10x10 box", "Must use only circles", "Must be symmetric")
- **description**: Extract constraint description from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render constraints

### 2. DesignSpace Object - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications:**

- **elements**: Extract element data from component_specifications:
  - **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "element1", "element2", "shape_a")
  - **label**: Extract exact element label from component_specifications (e.g., "Circle", "Square", "Triangle")
  - **properties**: Extract element properties from component_specifications (if applicable, e.g., {"radius": 5, "color": "blue"})
  - **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render elements

- **canvas**: Extract canvas dimensions from component_specifications:
  - **width**: Extract canvas width from component_specifications (e.g., 800, 1000)
  - **height**: Extract canvas height from component_specifications (e.g., 600, 800)
  - **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides canvas visualization

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "design_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Design a shape that meets all constraints", "Build a design")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Design Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "design canvas", "constraint builder", "design tool") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and design tool styling

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "design canvas", "constraint builder", "design tool") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "design blue", "constraint gray", "canvas white")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "design", "creative", "technical", "educational")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: constraint text, element data, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "canvas"` or `type: "design"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
