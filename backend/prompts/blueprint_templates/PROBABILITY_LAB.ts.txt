## PROBABILITY_LAB Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Experiments Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each experiment, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "experiment1", "experiment2", "trial_a")
- **name**: Extract exact experiment name from component_specifications (e.g., "Coin Toss", "Dice Roll", "Card Draw")
- **description**: Extract experiment description from component_specifications (e.g., "Flip a coin 10 times", "Roll a die 6 times")
- **parameters**: Extract experiment parameters from component_specifications (if applicable, e.g., {"numTrials": 10, "numSides": 6})
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render experiments

### 2. Parameters Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each parameter, extract from component_specifications.interactive_elements:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "numTrials", "probability", "sampleSize")
- **label**: Extract exact parameter label from component_specifications (e.g., "Number of Trials", "Probability", "Sample Size")
- **min/max**: Extract from component_specifications (e.g., min: 1, max: 100 for numTrials)
- **defaultValue**: Extract initial value from component_specifications (e.g., 10 for numTrials)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render controls

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "probability_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "What is the probability of getting heads?", "Calculate the probability")
- **targetProbability**: Extract target probability from component_specifications.game_logic (if applicable, e.g., 0.5, 0.25)
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Probability Lab Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "probability lab", "experiment station", "statistical playground") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and lab interface styling

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "probability lab", "experiment station", "statistical playground") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "lab blue", "experiment green", "statistical purple")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "scientific", "statistical", "mathematical", "educational")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: experiment data, parameter values, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "lab"` or `type: "experiment"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
