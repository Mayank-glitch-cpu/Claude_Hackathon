## SEQUENCE_BUILDER Template Component Documentation

### Available Template Components:

1. **Step Components**:
   - **Step Cards**: Draggable cards representing steps in a sequence
   - **Step Content**: Text or images on step cards
   - **Step Ordering**: Correct order index for validation

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag steps to reorder them
   - **Drop Zones**: Areas where steps can be placed
   - **Submit Button**: Button to validate sequence
   - **Reset Button**: Button to reset order

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Correct Placement Feedback**: Visual feedback when step is in correct position
   - **Incorrect Placement Feedback**: Visual feedback when step is in wrong position
   - **Success Message**: Appears when sequence is correct
   - **Step Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of steps

## Component Customization Instructions:

### 1. Steps Array - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.interactive_elements:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "step1", "step2", "step3")
- **text**: Extract exact step text from component_specifications (e.g., "Mix ingredients", "Bake at 350°F", "Cool for 10 minutes")
- **orderIndex**: Extract correct order from component_specifications.game_logic (0-based index)
- **description**: Extract step description from component_specifications (if applicable)

### 2. Distractors Array - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.interactive_elements (if applicable):**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "distractor1", "distractor2")
- **text**: Extract distractor text from component_specifications (incorrect steps to include)
- **description**: Extract distractor description from component_specifications (if applicable)

### 3. Tasks Array - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "sequence_task")
- **type**: Use "sequence_order" for sequencing tasks
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Arrange the steps in the correct order", "Order the process steps")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed

### 4. AnimationCues Object - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.styling_details.animations:**

- **stepDrag**: Extract drag animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe drag animation when step is dragged (e.g., "Smooth movement, snap behavior")
  - Include duration, easing, visual effects
  - Example: "Steps move smoothly when dragged with snap behavior to drop zones."
  
- **correctPlacement**: Extract success animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe animation when step is correctly placed (e.g., "Green glow, checkmark")
  - Include duration, easing, visual effects
  - Example: "The step glows green for 0.5 seconds with a checkmark animation when correctly placed."
  
- **incorrectPlacement**: Extract error animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe animation when step is incorrectly placed (e.g., "Red shake, X mark")
  - Include duration, easing, visual effects
  - Example: "The step shakes red for 0.3 seconds with an X mark animation when incorrectly placed."
  
- **sequenceComplete**: Extract completion animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe animation when all steps are correctly ordered
  - Include visual effects, duration
  - Example: "A celebration animation with sparkles and a success message appears when the sequence is correct."

### 5. Title and NarrativeIntro - Customize for Question:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Recipe Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)

## Key Customization Guidelines:

1. **Extract specific values** from component_specifications (step text, order index, animation details)
2. **Customize step text** with exact text from component_specifications
3. **Customize order index** from component_specifications.game_logic
4. **Customize animations** with detailed descriptions from component_specifications.styling_details
5. **Include production-quality details** that enable rendering a polished, interactive game
6. **Adapt all components** to the specific question while using the template's component set
