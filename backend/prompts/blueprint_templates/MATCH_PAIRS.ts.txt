## Component Customization Instructions:

### 1. Pairs Array - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.interactive_elements:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "pair1", "pair2", "pair3")
- **leftItem**:
  - **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "left1", "left2", "left3")
  - **text**: Extract exact text from component_specifications (e.g., "Heart", "Circulatory System", "2+2")
  - **imageUrl**: Extract image URL or description from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **rightItem**:
  - **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "right1", "right2", "right3")
  - **text**: Extract exact text from component_specifications (e.g., "Pumps blood", "Blood circulation", "4")
  - **imageUrl**: Extract image URL or description from component_specifications (if applicable)

### 2. Tasks Array - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "match_task")
- **type**: Use "match_pairs" for matching tasks
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Match each term with its definition", "Match each equation with its solution")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed

### 3. AnimationCues Object - Customize for Question:

**Extract from component_specifications.styling_details.animations:**

- **cardFlip**: Extract flip animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe flip animation when card is revealed (e.g., "3D flip animation, 0.5 seconds, ease-out")
  - Include duration, easing, visual effects
  - Example: "Cards flip with a 3D rotation animation over 0.5 seconds with ease-out easing when clicked."
  
- **cardMatch**: Extract success animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe animation when pair is correctly matched (e.g., "Green glow, connection line, checkmark")
  - Include duration, easing, visual effects
  - Example: "Matched cards glow green with a connection line animation and checkmark when correctly matched."
  
- **cardMismatch**: Extract error animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe animation when pair is incorrectly matched (e.g., "Red shake, X mark, cards flip back")
  - Include duration, easing, visual effects
  - Example: "Mismatched cards shake red with an X mark animation and flip back face-down after 1 second."
  
- **allMatched**: Extract completion animation from component_specifications:
  - Describe animation when all pairs are matched
  - Include visual effects, duration
  - Example: "A celebration animation with sparkles and a success message appears when all pairs are matched."

2. **Customize card content** based on question context (terms, definitions, equations, solutions, etc.)
3. **Customize card text** with exact text from component_specifications
4. **Customize animations** with detailed descriptions from component_specifications.styling_details
5. **Include production-quality details** that enable rendering a polished, interactive game
6. **Adapt all components** to the specific question while using the template's component set
