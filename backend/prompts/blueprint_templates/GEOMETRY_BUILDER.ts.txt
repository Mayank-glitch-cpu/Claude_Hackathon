## GEOMETRY_BUILDER Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Shapes Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each shape, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "shape1", "shape2", "circle_a")
- **required**: Extract from component_specifications.game_logic (true if shape must be included in solution)
- **properties**: Extract shape properties from component_specifications (e.g., {"type": "circle", "radius": 5, "center": {"x": 10, "y": 10}})
  - **DO NOT** include `type` field in properties - the React component interprets shape from properties
  - Extract only data values: dimensions, positions, colors, etc.
- **DO NOT** include `type` field at shape level - the React component decides how to render shapes

### 2. Tools Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each tool, extract from component_specifications.interactive_elements:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "tool1", "tool2", "circle_tool")
- **label**: Extract exact tool label from component_specifications (e.g., "Circle Tool", "Line Tool", "Angle Tool")
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render tools

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "geometry_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Build a triangle with sides 3, 4, 5", "Construct a circle with radius 5")
- **targetShape**: Extract target shape from component_specifications.game_logic (if applicable):
  - **properties**: Extract target shape properties (e.g., {"sides": [3, 4, 5], "type": "triangle"})
  - **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component interprets shape from properties
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Geometry Builder Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "geometry builder", "shape constructor", "geometric tool") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and geometry tool styling

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "geometry builder", "shape constructor", "geometric tool") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "geometric blue", "shape green", "tool gray")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "geometric", "mathematical", "technical", "educational")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: shape properties, tool labels, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "geometry"` or `type: "builder"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
