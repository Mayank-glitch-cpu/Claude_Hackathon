## CONCEPT_MAP_BUILDER Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Concepts Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each concept, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "concept1", "concept2", "idea_a")
- **label**: Extract exact concept label from component_specifications (e.g., "Photosynthesis", "Energy", "Concept A")
- **description**: Extract concept description from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **required**: Extract from component_specifications.game_logic (true if concept must be included)
- **initialX, initialY**: Extract normalized positions (0-1) from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render concepts

### 2. Connections Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each connection, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "connection1", "connection2", "link_ab")
- **fromConceptId**: Extract source concept ID from component_specifications
- **toConceptId**: Extract target concept ID from component_specifications
- **label**: Extract connection label from component_specifications (if applicable, e.g., "causes", "leads to", "related to")
- **required**: Extract from component_specifications.game_logic (true if connection must be included)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render connections

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "concept_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Build a concept map", "Connect the concepts")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Concept Map Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "concept map", "mind map", "knowledge network") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and concept map styling

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "concept map", "mind map", "knowledge network") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "concept blue", "mind map green", "knowledge network purple")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "educational", "scientific", "creative", "analytical")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: concept labels, connection relationships, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "concept"` or `type: "map"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
