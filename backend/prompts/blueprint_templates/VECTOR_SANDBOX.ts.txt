## VECTOR_SANDBOX Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Vectors Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each vector, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "vector1", "vector2", "force_a")
- **label**: Extract exact vector label from component_specifications (e.g., "Force A", "Velocity", "Vector 1")
- **initialX, initialY**: Extract normalized positions (0-1) from component_specifications
- **magnitude**: Extract magnitude from component_specifications (e.g., 5, 10, 15)
- **angle**: Extract angle in degrees from component_specifications (e.g., 0, 45, 90)
- **color**: Extract color from component_specifications (if applicable, e.g., "red", "blue", "green")
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render vectors

### 2. Operations Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each operation, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "add", "subtract", "multiply")
- **label**: Extract exact operation label from component_specifications (e.g., "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply")
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render operations

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "vector_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Add the vectors", "Calculate the result")
- **targetResult**: Extract target result from component_specifications.game_logic (if applicable):
  - **magnitude**: Extract target magnitude (if applicable)
  - **angle**: Extract target angle (if applicable)
  - **components**: Extract target components (if applicable)
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Vector Calculation Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "vector space", "coordinate system", "mathematical playground") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and vector styling

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "vector space", "coordinate system", "mathematical playground") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "mathematical blue", "scientific gray", "technical green")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "mathematical", "scientific", "technical", "educational")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: vector data, operation labels, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "vector"` or `type: "canvas"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
