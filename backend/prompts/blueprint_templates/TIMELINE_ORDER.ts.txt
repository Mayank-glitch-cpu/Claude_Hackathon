## TIMELINE_ORDER Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Events Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each event, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "event1", "event2", "event3")
- **text**: Extract exact event text from component_specifications (e.g., "World War II begins", "First moon landing")
- **timestamp**: Extract numeric timestamp from component_specifications (for ordering)
- **description**: Extract event description from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render events

### 2. Timeline Object - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications:**

- **startTime**: Extract start time from component_specifications (e.g., 0, 1900, 0)
- **endTime**: Extract end time from component_specifications (e.g., 100, 2000, 10)
- **unit**: Extract unit from component_specifications (e.g., "years", "steps", "seconds")
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides timeline visualization

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "timeline_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Arrange events in chronological order")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The History Timeline Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "historical timeline", "process flow", "chronological sequence") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and timeline styling

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "historical timeline", "process flow", "chronological sequence") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "historical sepia", "scientific blue", "industrial gray")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "historical", "scientific", "industrial", "creative")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: event text, timestamps, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "timeline"` or `type: "chart"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
