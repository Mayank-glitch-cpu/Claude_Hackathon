## BUCKET_SORT Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Buckets Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each bucket, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "bucket1", "bucket2", "category_a")
- **label**: Extract exact bucket label from component_specifications (e.g., "Mammals", "Vertebrates", "Category A")
- **description**: Extract bucket description from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render buckets

### 2. Items Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each item, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "item1", "item2", "dog")
- **text**: Extract exact item text from component_specifications (e.g., "Dog", "Cat", "Bird")
- **correctBucketId**: Extract correct bucket ID from component_specifications.game_logic (which bucket this item belongs to)
- **description**: Extract item description from component_specifications (if applicable)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render items

### 3. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "sort_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Sort items into correct categories")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 4. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Classification Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "sorting buckets", "classification bins", "category containers") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and bucket designs

### 5. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "sorting buckets", "classification bins", "category containers") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "colorful buckets", "organized bins", "labeled containers")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "organizational", "scientific", "educational", "creative")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: bucket labels, item text, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "bucket"` or `type: "drag-drop"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
