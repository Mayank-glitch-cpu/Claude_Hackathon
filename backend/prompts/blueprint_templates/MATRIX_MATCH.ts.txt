## MATRIX_MATCH Data Extraction Instructions

**CRITICAL: Extract ONLY data values. DO NOT include UI hints or animation descriptions.**

### 1. Rows Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each row, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "row1", "row2", "category_a")
- **label**: Extract exact row label from component_specifications (e.g., "Mammals", "Vertebrates", "Category A")
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render rows

### 2. Columns Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each column, extract from component_specifications:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID based on question (e.g., "col1", "col2", "property_x")
- **label**: Extract exact column label from component_specifications (e.g., "Has fur", "Lives in water", "Property X")
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render columns

### 3. Matches Array - Extract Data Only:

**For each match, extract from component_specifications.game_logic:**

- **rowId**: Extract row ID from component_specifications (which row this match belongs to)
- **columnId**: Extract column ID from component_specifications (which column this match belongs to)
- **isCorrect**: Extract correctness from component_specifications.game_logic (true if this match is correct)
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides how to render matches

### 4. Tasks Array - Extract Data Only:

**Extract from component_specifications.game_logic and question_flow:**

- **id**: Use descriptive ID (e.g., "task1", "matrix_task")
- **questionText**: Extract from question_flow or component_specifications (e.g., "Match rows with columns")
- **requiredToProceed**: Set to true if task must be completed
- **DO NOT** include `type` field - the React component decides task handling
- **DO NOT** include animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

### 5. Title and NarrativeIntro - Extract Data:

**Extract from story_data:**

- **title**: Extract from story_title (e.g., "The Matrix Matching Challenge")
- **narrativeIntro**: Extract from story_context or narrativeIntro (full narrative description)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Include full narrative text as it contains visual metaphors (e.g., "matching matrix", "grid game", "table matching") that the React component will use to determine visual styling and theming
  - The component will extract visual metaphors from this text to adapt colors, backgrounds, and grid styling

### 6. Visual Styling Extraction:

**Extract visual metaphors and styling hints from narrativeIntro:**

- **Visual Metaphors**: The narrativeIntro may contain visual metaphors (e.g., "matching matrix", "grid game", "table matching") that inform the component's visual design
- **Color Schemes**: Extract color hints from narrative context (e.g., "organized grid", "matching table", "classification matrix")
- **Theming**: Extract theme context from narrativeIntro (e.g., "organizational", "scientific", "educational", "analytical")
- **DO NOT** specify exact colors or styles - the component interprets these metaphors
- **DO NOT** include `animationCues` or animation descriptions - components have built-in animations

## Key Guidelines:

1. **Extract ONLY data values**: row labels, column labels, match data, question text
2. **DO NOT** include UI hints like `type: "matrix"` or `type: "grid"`
3. **DO NOT** include `animationCues` objects or animation descriptions
4. **DO NOT** specify how components should render - components are smart and decide this
5. **Include visual metaphors** in narrativeIntro - components extract styling from these
6. The React component will render high-quality UI with built-in animations based on the data you provide
