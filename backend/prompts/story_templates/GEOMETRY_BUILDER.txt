### Template Context: GEOMETRY_BUILDER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Construct geometric shapes and solve geometry problems.
- Canvas allows drawing geometric shapes.
- Shape properties are validated on submission.

## Template Component Inventory

GEOMETRY_BUILDER template provides the following components that can be customized for any question:

### Available Components:

1. **Geometry Components**:
   - **Drawing Canvas**: Canvas for geometric construction
   - **Geometric Shapes**: Shapes that can be drawn (circles, lines, polygons, etc.)
   - **Construction Tools**: Tools for geometric construction (compass, ruler, protractor, etc.)
   - **Shape Styling**: Colors, borders, shadows for shapes

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Shape Drawing**: Draw shapes on canvas
   - **Shape Manipulation**: Move, resize, rotate shapes
   - **Tool Selection**: Select construction tools
   - **Point Placement**: Place points on canvas
   - **Submit Button**: Button to validate construction
   - **Reset Button**: Button to clear canvas

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Correct Construction Feedback**: Visual feedback when construction is correct
   - **Incorrect Construction Feedback**: Visual feedback when construction is incorrect
   - **Success Message**: Appears when construction is correct
   - **Shape Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of shapes

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - **Question Container**: Top area for instructions/question text
   - **Canvas Pane**: Main area for geometric construction
   - **Tools Pane**: Area for construction tools
   - **Properties Pane**: Area for shape properties display (if needed)
   - **Controls Pane**: Bottom area for submit/reset buttons

5. **Animation Components**:
   - **Shape Drawing Animation**: Visual feedback when shape is drawn
   - **Tool Usage Animation**: Visual feedback when tool is used
   - **Construction Validation Animation**: Success/error animation on validation
   - **Shape Highlight Animation**: Highlight animation for shapes

## Customization Guidance

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, animation_cues, and component_specifications:

### 1. Geometry Component Customization:
- **Shape Types**: Extract shape types from component_specifications (circles, lines, polygons, angles, etc.)
- **Construction Tools**: Extract tool types from component_specifications (compass, ruler, protractor, etc.)
- **Shape Configuration**: Customize number, properties of shapes based on question
- **Shape Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, line styles from component_specifications

### 2. Interactive Element Customization:
- **Drawing Tools**: Extract tool configurations from component_specifications (draw tool, select tool, etc.)
- **Manipulation Behavior**: Customize drag, resize, rotate behavior from component_specifications
- **Point Placement**: Customize point placement behavior, snap behavior from component_specifications
- **Button Labels**: Extract button text from component_specifications (e.g., "Submit", "Reset", "Clear")
- **Button Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, hover effects from component_specifications

### 3. Feedback Element Customization:
- **Correct Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., green glow, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., red shake, X mark)
- **Success Message**: Extract text, styling, animation from component_specifications
- **Shape Highlighting**: Extract highlight color, animation, duration from component_specifications

### 4. Animation Customization:
- **Shape Drawing**: Extract drawing animation details from component_specifications (line drawing, shape creation, etc.)
- **Tool Usage**: Extract tool usage animation from component_specifications (compass arc, ruler line, etc.)
- **Construction Validation**: Extract validation animation from component_specifications (glow, highlight, checkmark)
- **Shape Highlight**: Extract highlight animation from component_specifications (pulse, glow, etc.)

### 5. Game Logic Customization:
- **Construction Requirements**: Extract required construction from component_specifications (shapes, properties, relationships)
- **Shape Properties**: Extract shape properties from component_specifications (angles, lengths, areas, etc.)
- **Win Condition**: Extract win condition from component_specifications (correct construction, correct properties)
- **Validation Logic**: Extract validation rules from component_specifications

## Key Requirements:

- Focus on geometric construction, spatial reasoning, and shape properties.
- Visual elements should represent geometric shapes, tools, and construction lines.
- Questions should involve constructing shapes or understanding geometric properties.
- Animation cues should show shape construction, tool usage, and property validation.
- **Extract detailed component specifications** that can be used to render a production-quality game.
- **Customize all components** for the specific question while using the template's component set.
