### Template Context: SEQUENCE_BUILDER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Drag-and-drop interface to arrange steps in correct order.
- Steps are represented as cards that can be reordered.
- Correct ordering is validated on submission.

## Template Component Inventory

SEQUENCE_BUILDER template provides the following components that can be customized for any question:

### Available Components:

1. **Step Components**:
   - **Step Cards**: Draggable cards representing steps in a sequence
   - **Step Content**: Text or images on step cards
   - **Step Ordering**: Correct order index for validation

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag steps to reorder them
   - **Drop Zones**: Areas where steps can be placed
   - **Submit Button**: Button to validate sequence
   - **Reset Button**: Button to reset order

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Correct Placement Feedback**: Visual feedback when step is in correct position
   - **Incorrect Placement Feedback**: Visual feedback when step is in wrong position
   - **Success Message**: Appears when sequence is correct
   - **Step Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of steps

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - **Question Container**: Top area for instructions/question text
   - **Steps Pane**: Main area for step cards (unordered initially)
   - **Sequence Pane**: Area for ordered steps (drop zones)
   - **Controls Pane**: Bottom area for submit/reset buttons

5. **Animation Components**:
   - **Step Drag Animation**: Smooth dragging animation
   - **Correct Placement Animation**: Success effect when step is correctly placed
   - **Incorrect Placement Animation**: Error effect when step is incorrectly placed
   - **Sequence Complete Animation**: Success animation when all steps are correctly ordered

## Customization Guidance

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, animation_cues, and component_specifications:

### 1. Step Component Customization:
- **Step Text**: Extract exact step text from component_specifications (e.g., "Mix ingredients", "Bake at 350°F", "Cool for 10 minutes")
- **Step Styling**: Extract colors, fonts, borders, shadows from component_specifications
- **Step Count**: Extract number of steps from component_specifications
- **Step Order**: Extract correct order from component_specifications

### 2. Interactive Element Customization:
- **Drag Behavior**: Customize drag animation, snap behavior, drop zones from component_specifications
- **Drop Zones**: Extract drop zone styling, positioning from component_specifications
- **Button Labels**: Extract button text from component_specifications (e.g., "Submit", "Reset", "Check Order")
- **Button Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, hover effects from component_specifications

### 3. Feedback Element Customization:
- **Correct Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., green glow, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., red shake, X mark)
- **Success Message**: Extract text, styling, animation from component_specifications
- **Step Highlighting**: Extract highlight color, animation, duration from component_specifications

### 4. Animation Customization:
- **Step Drag**: Extract drag animation details from component_specifications (smooth movement, snap behavior)
- **Correct Placement**: Extract success animation from component_specifications (glow, highlight, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Placement**: Extract error animation from component_specifications (shake, flash, X)
- **Sequence Complete**: Extract completion animation from component_specifications (celebration, glow, etc.)

### 5. Game Logic Customization:
- **Ordering Logic**: Extract correct sequence order from component_specifications
- **Win Condition**: Extract win condition from component_specifications (all steps in correct order)
- **Validation Logic**: Extract validation rules from component_specifications

## Key Requirements:

- Emphasize ordered steps, processes, or sequences.
- Visual elements should represent discrete steps that have a natural order.
- Questions should involve ordering or sequencing tasks.
- Animation cues should show step transitions and correct/incorrect placement.
- **Extract detailed component specifications** that can be used to render a production-quality game.
- **Customize all components** for the specific question while using the template's component set.
