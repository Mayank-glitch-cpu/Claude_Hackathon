### Template Context: VECTOR_SANDBOX

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Interactive vector manipulation and visualization.
- Vectors are draggable and resizable.
- Operations can be applied to vectors.

## Template Component Inventory

VECTOR_SANDBOX template provides the following components that can be customized for any question:

### Available Components:

1. **Vector Components**:
   - **Vectors**: Draggable/resizable arrows representing vectors
   - **Vector Labels**: Labels showing vector names or values
   - **Coordinate System**: Grid or axes for vector positioning
   - **Vector Operations**: Visual representation of operations (addition, subtraction, etc.)

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Vector Drag**: Drag vectors to reposition
   - **Vector Resize**: Resize vectors to change magnitude
   - **Vector Rotate**: Rotate vectors to change direction
   - **Operation Buttons**: Buttons to apply vector operations
   - **Submit Button**: Button to validate vector configuration
   - **Reset Button**: Button to reset vectors

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Correct Configuration Feedback**: Visual feedback when vector configuration is correct
   - **Incorrect Configuration Feedback**: Visual feedback when vector configuration is incorrect
   - **Success Message**: Appears when target is reached
   - **Vector Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of vectors

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - **Question Container**: Top area for instructions/question text
   - **Canvas Pane**: Main area for vector visualization
   - **Controls Pane**: Bottom area for operation buttons and submit/reset

5. **Animation Components**:
   - **Vector Manipulation Animation**: Visual feedback when vector is moved/resized
   - **Operation Animation**: Visual feedback when operation is applied
   - **Result Animation**: Success/error animation on validation
   - **Vector Highlight Animation**: Highlight animation for vectors

## Customization Guidance

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, animation_cues, and component_specifications:

### 1. Vector Component Customization:
- **Vector Configuration**: Customize number, labels, initial positions of vectors based on question
- **Coordinate System**: Extract coordinate system styling from component_specifications (grid, axes, etc.)
- **Vector Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, arrow styling from component_specifications
- **Vector Operations**: Extract operation types from component_specifications (addition, subtraction, dot product, etc.)

### 2. Interactive Element Customization:
- **Manipulation Tools**: Extract tool configurations from component_specifications (drag, resize, rotate)
- **Operation Buttons**: Extract button labels, actions from component_specifications (e.g., "Add Vectors", "Subtract Vectors")
- **Button Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, hover effects from component_specifications
- **Interaction Behavior**: Customize drag, resize, rotate behavior from component_specifications

### 3. Feedback Element Customization:
- **Correct Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., green glow, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., red shake, X mark)
- **Success Message**: Extract text, styling, animation from component_specifications
- **Vector Highlighting**: Extract highlight color, animation, duration from component_specifications

### 4. Animation Customization:
- **Vector Manipulation**: Extract manipulation animation details from component_specifications (smooth movement, resize, rotate)
- **Operation**: Extract operation animation from component_specifications (visual operation result, connection lines)
- **Result**: Extract result animation from component_specifications (glow, highlight, checkmark)
- **Vector Highlight**: Extract highlight animation from component_specifications (pulse, glow, etc.)

### 5. Game Logic Customization:
- **Vector Configuration**: Extract required vector configuration from component_specifications (positions, magnitudes, directions)
- **Operations**: Extract required operations from component_specifications (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- **Win Condition**: Extract win condition from component_specifications (correct vector configuration or operation result)
- **Validation Logic**: Extract validation rules from component_specifications

## Key Requirements:

- Focus on vector mathematics, physics, and spatial relationships.
- Visual elements should represent vectors as arrows with magnitude and direction.
- Questions should involve vector operations or understanding vector properties.
- Animation cues should show vector manipulation and operation results.
- **Extract detailed component specifications** that can be used to render a production-quality game.
- **Customize all components** for the specific question while using the template's component set.
