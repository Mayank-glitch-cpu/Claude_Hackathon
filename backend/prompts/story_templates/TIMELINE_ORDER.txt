### Template Context: TIMELINE_ORDER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Chronological ordering of events on a timeline.
- Events are placed at specific time points.
- Timeline shows temporal relationships.

## Template Component Inventory

TIMELINE_ORDER template provides the following components that can be customized for any question:

### Available Components:

1. **Timeline Components**:
   - **Timeline Axis**: Horizontal or vertical timeline showing time progression
   - **Event Markers**: Markers or cards representing events
   - **Event Content**: Text or images on event markers
   - **Time Labels**: Time points or dates on timeline

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Event Drag**: Drag events to place on timeline
   - **Event Click**: Click to view event details
   - **Submit Button**: Button to validate timeline order
   - **Reset Button**: Button to reset timeline

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Correct Placement Feedback**: Visual feedback when event is in correct position
   - **Incorrect Placement Feedback**: Visual feedback when event is in wrong position
   - **Success Message**: Appears when timeline is correct
   - **Event Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of events

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - **Question Container**: Top area for instructions/question text
   - **Timeline Pane**: Main area for timeline display
   - **Events Pane**: Area for event markers (unordered initially)
   - **Controls Pane**: Bottom area for submit/reset buttons

5. **Animation Components**:
   - **Event Drag Animation**: Smooth dragging animation
   - **Timeline Progression Animation**: Visual progression along timeline
   - **Correct Placement Animation**: Success effect when event is correctly placed
   - **Incorrect Placement Animation**: Error effect when event is incorrectly placed

## Customization Guidance

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, animation_cues, and component_specifications:

### 1. Timeline Component Customization:
- **Timeline Type**: Select appropriate timeline based on question context (historical events, process steps, chronological order, etc.)
- **Event Configuration**: Customize number and content of events based on question
- **Time Scale**: Extract time scale from component_specifications (dates, time points, steps, etc.)
- **Timeline Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows from component_specifications

### 2. Event Component Customization:
- **Event Text**: Extract exact event text from component_specifications (e.g., "Battle of Hastings", "Mix ingredients", "Start process")
- **Event Styling**: Extract colors, fonts, borders, shadows from component_specifications
- **Event Count**: Extract number of events from component_specifications
- **Event Order**: Extract correct chronological order from component_specifications

### 3. Interactive Element Customization:
- **Drag Behavior**: Customize drag animation, snap behavior, timeline positioning from component_specifications
- **Timeline Interaction**: Customize timeline click, zoom, pan from component_specifications
- **Button Labels**: Extract button text from component_specifications (e.g., "Submit", "Reset", "Check Order")
- **Button Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, hover effects from component_specifications

### 4. Feedback Element Customization:
- **Correct Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., green glow, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., red shake, X mark)
- **Success Message**: Extract text, styling, animation from component_specifications
- **Event Highlighting**: Extract highlight color, animation, duration from component_specifications

### 5. Animation Customization:
- **Event Drag**: Extract drag animation details from component_specifications (smooth movement, snap to timeline)
- **Timeline Progression**: Extract progression animation from component_specifications (visual flow along timeline)
- **Correct Placement**: Extract success animation from component_specifications (glow, highlight, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Placement**: Extract error animation from component_specifications (shake, flash, X)

### 6. Game Logic Customization:
- **Chronological Logic**: Extract correct chronological order from component_specifications
- **Win Condition**: Extract win condition from component_specifications (all events in correct chronological order)
- **Validation Logic**: Extract validation rules from component_specifications

## Key Requirements:

- Focus on temporal sequences and historical or process timelines.
- Visual elements should represent time progression and events.
- Questions should involve chronological ordering or time-based relationships.
- Animation cues should show timeline progression and event placement.
- **Extract detailed component specifications** that can be used to render a production-quality game.
- **Customize all components** for the specific question while using the template's component set.
