### Template Context: GRAPH_SKETCHER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Draw or manipulate graphs, nodes, and edges.
- Canvas allows drawing and editing graph structures.
- Graph structure is validated on submission.

## Template Component Inventory

GRAPH_SKETCHER template provides the following components that can be customized for any question:

### Available Components:

1. **Graph Components**:
   - **Canvas**: Drawing area for graph construction
   - **Nodes**: Draggable nodes representing vertices
   - **Edges**: Lines connecting nodes
   - **Node Labels**: Text labels on nodes

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Node Creation**: Click to create nodes
   - **Node Drag**: Drag nodes to reposition
   - **Edge Drawing**: Draw edges between nodes
   - **Node/Edge Deletion**: Delete nodes or edges
   - **Submit Button**: Button to validate graph
   - **Reset Button**: Button to clear canvas

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Correct Graph Feedback**: Visual feedback when graph is correct
   - **Incorrect Graph Feedback**: Visual feedback when graph is incorrect
   - **Success Message**: Appears when graph is correct
   - **Node/Edge Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of nodes/edges

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - **Question Container**: Top area for instructions/question text
   - **Canvas Pane**: Main area for graph drawing
   - **Tools Pane**: Area for drawing tools (if needed)
   - **Controls Pane**: Bottom area for submit/reset buttons

5. **Animation Components**:
   - **Node Creation Animation**: Visual feedback when node is created
   - **Edge Drawing Animation**: Visual feedback when edge is drawn
   - **Graph Validation Animation**: Success/error animation on validation
   - **Node/Edge Highlight Animation**: Highlight animation for nodes/edges

## Customization Guidance

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, animation_cues, and component_specifications:

### 1. Graph Component Customization:
- **Graph Type**: Select appropriate graph type based on question context (directed, undirected, weighted, etc.)
- **Node Configuration**: Customize number, labels, styling of nodes based on question
- **Edge Configuration**: Customize edge types, weights, styling based on question
- **Graph Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows from component_specifications

### 2. Interactive Element Customization:
- **Drawing Tools**: Extract tool configurations from component_specifications (node tool, edge tool, etc.)
- **Drag Behavior**: Customize drag animation, snap behavior from component_specifications
- **Button Labels**: Extract button text from component_specifications (e.g., "Submit", "Reset", "Clear")
- **Button Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, hover effects from component_specifications

### 3. Feedback Element Customization:
- **Correct Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., green glow, checkmark)
- **Incorrect Feedback**: Extract animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., red shake, X mark)
- **Success Message**: Extract text, styling, animation from component_specifications
- **Node/Edge Highlighting**: Extract highlight color, animation, duration from component_specifications

### 4. Animation Customization:
- **Node Creation**: Extract creation animation details from component_specifications (fade-in, scale, etc.)
- **Edge Drawing**: Extract drawing animation from component_specifications (line drawing, connection animation)
- **Graph Validation**: Extract validation animation from component_specifications (glow, highlight, checkmark)
- **Node/Edge Highlight**: Extract highlight animation from component_specifications (pulse, glow, etc.)

### 5. Game Logic Customization:
- **Graph Structure**: Extract required graph structure from component_specifications (nodes, edges, properties)
- **Win Condition**: Extract win condition from component_specifications (correct graph structure)
- **Validation Logic**: Extract validation rules from component_specifications

## Key Requirements:

- Emphasize graph structures, networks, and relationships.
- Visual elements should represent nodes and edges.
- Questions should involve constructing or understanding graph structures.
- Animation cues should show node/edge creation and graph validation.
- **Extract detailed component specifications** that can be used to render a production-quality game.
- **Customize all components** for the specific question while using the template's component set.
