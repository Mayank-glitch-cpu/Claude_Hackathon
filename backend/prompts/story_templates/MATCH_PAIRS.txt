### Template Context: MATCH_PAIRS

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Match related pairs by clicking cards to reveal and connect them.
- Cards are flipped to reveal content.
- Matching pairs are highlighted when found.

## Template Component Inventory

MATCH_PAIRS template provides the following components that can be customized for any question:

### Available Components:

1. **Card Components**:
   - **Card Pairs**: Left and right items that need to be matched
   - **Card Content**: Text or images on cards
   - **Card States**: Face-down (hidden) and face-up (revealed) states

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Card Click**: Click to flip and reveal card content
   - **Card Selection**: Select two cards to attempt a match
   - **Match Connection**: Visual connection between matched pairs
   - **Reset Button**: Button to reset game state

3. **Feedback Elements**:
   - **Match Feedback**: Visual feedback when pair is correctly matched
   - **Mismatch Feedback**: Visual feedback when pair is incorrectly matched
   - **Success Message**: Appears when all pairs are matched
   - **Card Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of selected cards

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - **Question Container**: Top area for instructions/question text
   - **Cards Pane**: Main area for card display (left and right columns)
   - **Controls Pane**: Bottom area for reset button (if needed)

5. **Animation Components**:
   - **Card Flip Animation**: Smooth flip animation when card is revealed
   - **Match Animation**: Success animation when pair is matched (glow, connection line, etc.)
   - **Mismatch Animation**: Error animation when pair is mismatched (shake, flash, etc.)
   - **All Matched Animation**: Success animation when all pairs are matched

## Customization Guidance

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, animation_cues, and component_specifications:

### 1. Card Component Customization:
- **Card Content**: Extract text or image descriptions from component_specifications (e.g., "Heart" and "Circulatory System", "2+2" and "4")
- **Card Styling**: Extract colors, borders, shadows, fonts from component_specifications
- **Card Layout**: Extract positioning, spacing, grid arrangement from component_specifications
- **Card Count**: Extract number of pairs from component_specifications

### 2. Interactive Element Customization:
- **Flip Behavior**: Customize flip animation, duration, easing from component_specifications
- **Selection Behavior**: Customize selection feedback, highlighting from component_specifications
- **Match Connection**: Extract connection style from component_specifications (line, glow, etc.)
- **Button Labels**: Extract button text from component_specifications (e.g., "Reset", "New Game")

### 3. Feedback Element Customization:
- **Match Feedback**: Extract success animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., green glow, checkmark, connection line)
- **Mismatch Feedback**: Extract error animation, color, duration from component_specifications (e.g., red shake, X mark)
- **Success Message**: Extract text, styling, animation from component_specifications
- **Card Highlighting**: Extract highlight color, animation, duration from component_specifications

### 4. Animation Customization:
- **Card Flip**: Extract flip animation details from component_specifications (3D flip, duration, easing)
- **Match**: Extract success animation from component_specifications (glow, connection line, checkmark)
- **Mismatch**: Extract error animation from component_specifications (shake, flash, X)
- **All Matched**: Extract completion animation from component_specifications (celebration, glow, etc.)

### 5. Game Logic Customization:
- **Pairing Logic**: Extract matching rules from component_specifications (which left item matches which right item)
- **Win Condition**: Extract win condition from component_specifications (all pairs correctly matched)
- **Selection Logic**: Extract selection rules from component_specifications (two cards at a time, etc.)

## Key Requirements:

- Focus on relationships, associations, and pairings.
- Visual elements should represent pairs that need to be matched.
- Questions should involve finding relationships or connections.
- Animation cues should include card flips, matches, and pair highlighting.
- **Extract detailed component specifications** that can be used to render a production-quality game.
- **Customize all components** for the specific question while using the template's component set.
