### Template Context: STATE_TRACER_CODE

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Step through code execution and track variable states.
- Code is displayed with line-by-line execution.
- Variable states are tracked and displayed at each step.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Emphasize stepping through execution, variable states, and debugging.
- Visual elements should represent code lines, variables, and state changes.
- Questions should involve predicting variable values or execution flow.
- Animation cues should show line highlighting, state updates, and step progression.
